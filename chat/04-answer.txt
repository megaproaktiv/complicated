According to the insurance policy document from Zombie Apocalypse Insurance, the Protection Against Viruses policy only covers virus-related incidents such as access to vaccines, medical treatments for viral infections, quarantine measures, and emergency evacuation during virus outbreaks.

For alien encounters, you would need either the Basic Insurance which includes "Protection Against Aliens" or the Premium Insurance which includes all Basic Insurance benefits plus vampire protection.

The 5th alien encounter is not covered under a Protection Against Viruses policy. You would need a policy that specifically includes alien protection.
