According to the insurance policy document from Zombie Apocalypse Insurance (ZAI), I need to clarify what coverage the customer has.

The customer has a Protection Against Viruses policy, which is part of the basic insurance coverage. However, alien encounters would fall under "Protection Against Aliens," which is also included in the basic insurance package.

The basic insurance policy includes protection against aliens, which covers:
- Defense and protective measures against extraterrestrial threats
- Provision of secure retreat locations
- Communication and negotiation with extraterrestrial life forms through specialized experts
- Coverage of damage to property and persons caused by extraterrestrial activities

Therefore, if the customer has the basic insurance policy (which includes virus protection), then the alien encounters would be covered as well, assuming they meet all other policy requirements and don't fall under any exclusions.

The Protection Against Viruses policy is valid, and alien encounters are covered under the basic insurance package.
