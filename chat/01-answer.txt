Based on the insurance policy document from Zombie Apocalypse Insurance (ZAI), I can provide the following clarification:

Your scenario with co-located vampires and zombies would be partially covered under a basic policy. The basic insurance specifically includes "Protection Against Zombies" which covers emergency shelters, evacuation services, medical treatment for bite wounds, psychological support, and financial support for property damage caused by zombies.

However, protection against vampires is only included in the Premium Insurance plan, not the basic plan. The Premium plan specifically adds "Protection against Vampires" which includes protective measures (garlic, holy water, crosses), financial protection, medical care, psychological support, and emergency evacuation during vampire attacks.

If you're dealing with both zombies and vampires, I would recommend upgrading to the Premium Insurance plan to ensure you have complete coverage for both types of threats. Otherwise, with just a basic policy, you would only be covered for the zombie-related damages and services.
