Based on the insurance policy document, I need to clarify something important about your coverage situation.

The "Protection Against Viruses" that you mention is part of the basic insurance package offered by Zombie Apocalypse Insurance. However, alien encounters would fall under a different section of coverage - specifically "Protection Against Aliens," which is also included in the basic insurance package.

According to the policy document, the Protection Against Aliens coverage includes:
- Defence and protective measures against extraterrestrial threats
- Provision of secure retreat locations
- Communication and negotiation with extraterrestrial life forms through specialized experts
- Coverage of damage to property and persons caused by extraterrestrial activities

So yes, assuming you have the basic insurance package (which includes both virus and alien protection), your alien encounters would be covered under the policy, provided they don't fall under any of the exclusions mentioned in section 3, such as:
- Intentional acts or gross negligence
- Participation in illegal activities
- Damage that occurred before the insurance commenced
- Damage related to military conflicts, terrorist acts, or nuclear incidents (unless directly related to the insured services)

Remember to notify the insurance company within 48 hours of any incidents as required by your policyholder obligations.
